# Acadia National Park Dashboard

The site is deployed here: https://distracted-pike-edbebd.netlify.app/

This was my original design idea mockup:

Note you can clone the repo but you'd have to get your own API keys for OpenWeather and api.data.gov. The names of the environment variables are:

```
REACT_APP_OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY=KEY
REACT_APP_NATIONAL_PARK_EVENTS_API_KEY=KEY
```

that can be placed in the `.env` file.
